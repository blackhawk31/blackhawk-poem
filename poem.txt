Blackhawk is my gaming handle .
Another options can be INS Mayur and Torpedo.
INS(Indian National Service)
its name can be changed as:
greenhawk
bluehawk
brownhawk
redhawk
greyhawk
too many names making it worse.

Hawk will remain my last name no mater what.
Now i feel changing my last name will not effect that much.
